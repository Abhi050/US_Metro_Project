# US_Metro_Project
In this project i imported the  data files(any data files, not real to be exact) and perform various statistical operation on them,like telling which station is busiest at a particular time interval or which station has more female commuters,etc.
I am open to suggestions and planningb to implement database in it to make it a bit industry ready.
Thanx!!!!!!

STEP 1:
open the file US_METRO.py in python 3.x.x

STEP 2:
import the data files from any source.format should be .csv .
Just make sure the name of data file should be that of city name.
if the name of the city is single word then name the file as xxxxxxx.csv otherwise if the name id more than a word long then 
name the file as xxx_xxxx.csv

STEP 3:
run the file and ENter the choice as asked by the user.




This is my first open sourced project so I am completely open to suggestion regarding code or coding style or regarding readme file.
